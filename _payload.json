Setup  Add the   remark-mdc  dependency to your project:       yarn     add     --dev     remark-mdc      npm     install     --save-dev     remark-mdc      pnpm     add     --save-dev     remark-mdc  Then, add   remark-mdc  to the   unified  streams:      import   { unified }   from     'unified'\n   import   remarkParse   from     'remark-parse'\n   import   remarkMDC   from     'remark-mdc'\n   \n   function     parse  (  md  :     string  ) {\n       const     processor     =     unified  ()\n     processor.  use  (remarkParse)\n   \n       // Use `remark-mdc` plugin to parse MDC syntax\n     processor.  use  (remarkMDC)\n   \n       // ...\n   \n       return   processor.  process  ({ value: content, data: frontmatter })\n   }  That's it! âœ¨  Syntax   ^-  Frontmatter  Front-matter is a convention of Markdown-based CMS to provide metadata to documents, like description or title. Remark MDC uses the YAML syntax with   key: value  pairs.  To define frontmatter, start your document with   ---\\n---  section and put your desired data in YAML format within this section.      ---\n   title  :   'Title of the page'\n   description  :   'meta description of the page'\n   ---\n   \n   \u003C!-- Content of the page -->   :  Inline Components  Inline components are entries that will stick inside the parent paragraph. Like spans, emojis, icons, etc. Inline components can be defined by a single   :  followed by the component name.      A simple :  inline-component  You may want to pass some text into an inline component; you can do it using the   [TEXT]  syntax.      A simple :  inline-component  [  John Doe  ]  If you want to use an inline component followed by specific characters like   - ,   _ , or   : , you can use a dummy props specifier after it.      How to say :  hello  {}-world in Markdown  In this example,   :hello{}  will search for the   \u003CHello />  component, and   -world  will be plain text.   Note: If you put an inline component alone in a single line, it will be transformed into a block component. This is sugar syntax for block components.      Paragraph a\n   \n   :  block-component\n   \n   Paragraph b   ::  Block Components  Block components are components that accept Markdown content or another component as a slot.  Block components are defined by the   ::  identifier.      ::  card\n   The content of the card\n   ::  Block components can be used without any content.      ::  card\n   ::  Or with sugar syntax. Note that in sugar syntax, it is important to put the component alone on a separate line.      A paragraph\n   \n   :  card   #  Slots  Block components can accept slots (like Vue slots) with different names. The content of these slots can be anything from a normal markdown paragraph to a nested block component.   The   default  slot renders the top-level content inside the block component.  Named slots use the   #  identifier to render the corresponding content.      ::  hero\n   Default slot text\n   \n   #description\n   This will be rendered inside the   `description`   slot.   :::  Nesting  MDC supports nested components inside slots by indenting them. To make nested components visually distinguishable, you can indent nested components and add more   :  when you define them.      ::  hero\n     :::  card\n       A nested card\n   \n       ::::card\n         A super nested card\n       ::::\n     :::\n   ::   []  Span  To create inline spans in your text, you can use the   []  identifier.      Hello [  World  ]  This syntax is useful in combination with inline props to make text visually different from the rest of the paragraph. Check out the inline props section to read more about props.      Hello [  World  ]{  .bg-blue-500  }!   {}  Inline Props  Using the inline props syntax, you can pass props and attributes to your components. MDC goes a step further and allows you to pass attributes to markdown native elements like images, links, bold texts, and more.  To define properties for a component or a markdown element, you need to create a props scope   {}  exactly after the component/element definition. Then you can define the properties inline within this scope using a   key=value  syntax.      Inline :  component  {key=\"value\" key2=value2}\n   \n   ::  block-component  {no-border     title  =  \"My Component\"  }\n   ::\n   \n   [  Link  ](https://nuxt.com){  class  =  \"nuxt\"  }\n   \n   ![  Nuxt Logo  ](  https://nuxt.com/assets/design-kit/logo/icon-green.svg  ){class=\".nuxt-logo\"}\n   \n   `code`  {style=\"color: red\"}\n   \n   _italic_  {style=\"color: blue\"}\n   \n   **bold**  {style=\"color: blue\"}  There are also a couple of sugar syntaxes for common use-cases:    id  attribute:   _italic_{#the_italic_text}   class  attribute:   **bold**{.bold .text.with_attribute}  No value (boolean props):   :component{no-border}  Single string without any space:   **bold**{class=red}  If you want to pass arrays or objects as props to components, you can pass them as a JSON string and prefix the prop key with a colon to automatically decode the JSON string. Note that in this case, you should use single quotes for the value string so you can use double quotes to pass a valid JSON string:      ::  dropdown  {:items  =  '[\"Nuxt\",     \"Vue\",     \"React\"]'}\n   String Array\n   ::\n   \n   ::  dropdown  {:items  =  '[1,2,3.5]'}\n   Number Array\n   ::\n   \n   ::chart{:options='{\"responsive\": true, \"scales\": {\"y\": {\"beginAtZero\": true}}}'}\n   Object\n   ::   ---  Yaml Props  The YAML method uses the   ---  identifier to declare one prop per line, which can be useful for readability.      ::  icon-card\n   ---\n   icon  :   IconNuxt\n   description  :   Harness the full power of Nuxt and the Nuxt ecosystem.\n   title  :   Nuxt Architecture.\n   ---\n   ::  Contributing  You can contribute to this module online with CodeSandbox:     Or locally:   Clone this repository  Install dependencies using   pnpm install  Start the development server using   pnpm dev  License   MIT License  Copyright (c) NuxtLabs  .dark .ct-970614{color:#B392F0;}\n.ct-970614{color:#6F42C1;}\n.dark .ct-948368{color:#E1E4E8;}\n.ct-948368{color:#24292E;}\n.dark .ct-497092{color:#9ECBFF;}\n.ct-497092{color:#032F62;}\n.dark .ct-484930{color:#79B8FF;}\n.ct-484930{color:#005CC5;}\n.dark .ct-135336{color:#F97583;}\n.ct-135336{color:#D73A49;}\n.dark .ct-684589{color:#FFAB70;}\n.ct-684589{color:#E36209;}\n.ct-086898{color:#6A737D;}\n.dark .ct-680237{color:#85E89D;}\n.ct-680237{color:#22863A;}\n.dark .ct-855666{color:#DBEDFF;text-decoration:bold;}\n.ct-855666{color:#032F62;text-decoration:bold;}\n.dark .ct-902184{color:#E1E4E8;text-decoration:bold;}\n.ct-902184{color:#24292E;text-decoration:bold;}\n.dark .ct-506094{color:#E1E4E8;font-style:italic;}\n.ct-506094{color:#24292E;font-style:italic;}\n.dark .ct-960556{color:#E1E4E8;font-weight:bold;}\n.ct-960556{color:#24292E;font-weight:bold;}"]
